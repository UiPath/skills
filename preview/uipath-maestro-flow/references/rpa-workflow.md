# RPA Workflow

*Behavior and worked examples. Exact signatures, fields, and defaults: [`rpaWorkflow()`](api.md#rpaworkflow-function).*

Run a published robotic process and wait for its output arguments.

Signature: `rpaWorkflow({ key, name, folderPath, inputs?, returns? })`.

```ts
.step('title', rpaWorkflow({ key: releaseKey,
  name: 'RPA Workflow', folderPath: 'Shared',
  inputs: { problemId: 123 }, returns: { title: 'string' } }))
```

## Tenant contract

The release key, name, and folder must identify the same deployed process.
Inputs and returns are that process's own argument names and exact casing; the
offline SDK cannot discover their truth. Inspect the registry/process listing
and the deployed contract rather than copying values from a different folder.

## Evidence boundary

Replay proves the graph with synthesized job output. Live evidence should show
a real Orchestrator job, the intended input arguments, completion, and the
returned values. Whether the robot performed the right UI/business work is a
separate assertion from job completion.
