# True-brownfield decompile, edit, and merge

Use this procedure when a task supplies a deployed `.flow` and no `.flow.ts`.
Do not hand-transcribe the graph: decompile it to builder source, edit that
source, and merge only the delta back into the original.

```bash
uip maestro flow decompile Deployed.flow -o Deployed.flow.ts
uip maestro flow compile Deployed -o Deployed.baseline.flow
# Edit Deployed.flow.ts narrowly; preserve existing step ids.
uip maestro flow compile Deployed -o Deployed.edited.flow
uip maestro flow merge Deployed.flow Deployed.edited.flow \
  -o Deployed.merged.flow --baseline Deployed.baseline.flow
```

The baseline must be compiled from the pristine decompiled source, before any
edit. It lets merge distinguish authored changes from reconstructed content;
without it, merge falls back to taking the compiled graph wholesale, including
layout.

Decompile reconstructs branch, switch, loop, parallel, error/ref, and
subflow structure. It preserves original node ids so merge can reattach them.
Every family the SDK can AUTHOR is reconstructed through its own factory —
including human tasks, agents and their attached resources, the published
resource families, queue items, the AI patterns, document steps, conversational
and voice steps, and connector event subscriptions. A recovered agent keeps its
`source` uuid, so its `agent.json` sidecar still resolves.

A node type the SDK has no factory for still round-trips: it comes back as
`rawNode({ nodeType, version, manifest, inputs })`, carrying the definition the
file supplied, so the node keeps its type, its version and its inputs. Leave it
alone unless the task asks you to change it — and if you do, edit its `inputs`,
not the hoisted `…Definition` const, which is the platform's own manifest.

`mock()` in decompiled source therefore means the flow really contains a
placeholder node (`core.logic.mock`). The one case that still degrades is a node
whose definition is MISSING from the file — nothing can carry it, so it lowers
to `mock() /* TODO: unsupported node type … */`; leave that node untouched and
merge restores the original.

Validate `Deployed.merged.flow`, not the intermediate edited compile. The
decompiler also emits `Deployed.pipeline.mjs`, which chains the same four
steps when a single command is more convenient.

## Split (`$ref`) artifacts

A deployed `.flow` may be SPLIT across sibling files with JSON Reference —
`"definitions": { "$ref": "./definitions.json" }`, or the same for layout or an
extracted subflow. Decompile resolves those into one model as it reads the file:
point it at the main file and nothing else is needed. Do NOT inline the sidecar
by hand first, and do not edit either file to "prepare" it — the recovered source
is identical either way.

Only relative paths resolve. An absolute path, a Windows drive letter, a
protocol URI (`https://…`, `file:///…`) or a traversal above the referencing
file's root is refused by design: a `.flow` is untrusted input, and the
alternative is a way to read arbitrary files. A same-document pointer
(`{"$ref": "#/definitions/…"}`) is left alone — those are legitimate internal
JSON-Schema pointers, not file references. A missing or unreadable target is an
error naming the file, not a silent gap.

Compile always writes ONE file. Write-through splitting is deliberately not
supported: nothing in the designer or the skills splits files today, so there is
no producer to round-trip against. Expect the recompiled artifact to carry the
sidecar's content inline, and no `$ref` — that is correct, not drift.
