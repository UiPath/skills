# UiPath Case Management Authoring Assistant

Builds UiPath Case Management definitions from `sdd.md`. Generates `tasks.md` plan, then writes `caseplan.json` directly via per-plugin JSON recipes. CLI is reserved for read-only metadata fetches (registry, validate, debug, tasks describe, case spec) and solution boundary operations (`uip solution init` / `project add` / `upload`).

When `sdd.md` is absent, **Phase 0 interview** generates one interactively (listen → sketch → progressive ask-walk → resolve → approve, with optional HTML preview before handing off). Complex / multi-product cases redirect to `uipath-design` — see [references/phase-0-interview.md § Thresholds](references/phase-0-interview.md#thresholds) for caps.

**Scope:** new case from `sdd.md` (user-provided or Phase 0-generated). Modifying existing case not supported (no remote fetch tooling).

## When to Use This Skill

- User provides `sdd.md` and wants Case Management project built
- User asks to create new case management project but has no `sdd.md` (Phase 0 interview generates one)
- User asks to create new case management project or definition
- User asks to generate implementation tasks from `sdd.md` or convert spec to plan
- User asks about case management JSON schema — nodes, transitions, tasks, rules, SLA
- User wants to manage runtime case instances (list, pause, resume, cancel) — see [references/case-commands.md](references/case-commands.md)

**Do not use for:** `.xaml` → `uipath-rpa`. `.flow` → `uipath-maestro-flow`. Standalone agents/APIs/processes outside case context → corresponding UiPath skill.

## Critical Rules

1. **Phase 0 interview when `sdd.md` absent.** Generate `sdd.md` via a guided interview (listen → sketch → progressive ask-walk → resolve → approve); output requires explicit user approval (Approve hard-stop) before treating as Rule 2 input. Apply complexity thresholds — soft-redirect to `uipath-design` on breach. Never overwrite an existing `sdd.md`. See [references/phase-0-interview.md § Thresholds](references/phase-0-interview.md#thresholds).
2. **sdd.md is sole input post-Phase-0.** After Phase 0 approval (or when user-provided), trust as written. Skill does not validate or gap-fill. If ambiguous, use AskUserQuestion — never infer silently.
3. **Run `uip maestro case registry pull` before planning.** Discovery reads cache files at `~/.uip/case-resources/<type>-index.json` directly. `registry search` has known gaps (esp. action-apps). See [references/registry-discovery.md](references/registry-discovery.md).
4. **`--output json` on every parsed read.**
5. **Follow plugin per node type.** Open matching `planning.md` during planning + `impl-json.md` during execution. Never guess JSON shapes from memory.
6. **`tasks.md` declarative only.** No shell commands inside. Field names use plain identifiers (e.g., `type:`, `displayName:`, `lane:`), not CLI flag syntax. One T-entry per sdd.md declaration — every stage, task, trigger, condition, SLA rule, **variable, and argument** gets own T-number, even when value looks like default (`current-stage-entered`, `case-entered`, `exit-only`, `is-interrupting: false`, `runOnlyOnce: true`, `marks-stage-complete: true`). Never group, never silently omit. **When an sdd.md row's format is unrecognized, ambiguous, or cannot be categorized — invoke AskUserQuestion before skipping. Silent omission is forbidden.** Always regenerate from scratch. See [`references/planning.md` §4.0](references/planning.md).
7. **HARD STOP after `tasks.md`.** AskUserQuestion: `Approve and proceed` / `Request changes`. Re-read `tasks.md` before executing.
8. **Unresolved resource → placeholder, never fabricate IDs.** Keep `<UNRESOLVED: ...>` markers in `tasks.md`. Placeholder **task**: node with `type` + `displayName` + structural fields, `data: {}`; conditions still reference the TaskId. Placeholder **event trigger**: node with render fields + `data.uipath: { serviceType: "Intsvc.EventTrigger" }` only (no other `data.uipath` keys); `entry-points.json` entry appended. No trigger-edge is created (edges retired) — the first stage's `case-entered` entry condition starts the case. See [references/placeholder-tasks.md](references/placeholder-tasks.md) and [references/plugins/triggers/event/impl-json.md § Placeholder fallback](references/plugins/triggers/event/impl-json.md).
9. **Persist every registry resolution to `registry-resolved.json`** — search query, all matches, selected result, rationale.
10. **Cross-task refs:** `"Stage Name"."Task Name".output_name` in planning, resolve to `=vars.<outputId>` at execution by reading source's `id` field (the resolver match key; `var` mirrors `id` on self-declaring task outputs but `.id` is symmetric with the runtime resolver per io-binding validator). Discover output names via `uip maestro case spec` (connector tasks) or `uip maestro case tasks describe` (non-connector tasks) — never fabricate. See [references/bindings-and-expressions.md](references/bindings-and-expressions.md) and [`plugins/variables/io-binding/impl-json.md`](references/plugins/variables/io-binding/impl-json.md).
11. **HARD STOP between Phase 2 (Prototyping) and Phase 3 (Implementation) — unconditional, every run.** Run `validate --skeleton` (structural checks only — skips tasks/SLAs/escalations/entry-exit rules), surface counts, present AskUserQuestion: `Publish for review` / `Skip publish and continue` / `Abort`. Do NOT halt on Phase 2 validate errors — advisory only; user inspects via `Abort`. Never skip prompt for auto mode, non-interactive mode, prior approval. If harness forbids prompts, halt with error. **On `Publish for review`: print `DesignerUrl` as plain-text output BEFORE invoking the second AskUserQuestion — never embed URL only inside question body.** Additional hard stops gate Phase 4 retry exhaustion (`Retry with fix` / `Pause for manual edit` / `Abort`), Phase 5 entry (`Run debug session` / `Skip to Publish`), and Phase 6 entry (`Publish to Studio Web` / `Done`). Full contract in [`references/phased-execution.md`](references/phased-execution.md).
12. **Never run `uip maestro case debug` automatically.** Executes case for real — emails, messages, API calls. Explicit user consent only.
13. **All skill artifacts: Read + Write/Edit only.** Applies to `caseplan.json`, `sdd.md`, `sdd.draft.md`, `tasks.md`, `tasks/registry-resolved.json`, `tasks/trigger-spec-cache.json`, `tasks/spec-cache.<elementId>.json`, `bindings_v2.json`, `id-map.json`, `entry-points.json`, `build-issues.md`. No `python`, `node`, `jq`, `sed`, `awk`, or scripts that open/parse/modify/save these files. **Specifically forbidden** (common slip): `node -e "...fs.writeFileSync..."`, `node -e "...fs.readFileSync..."`, `node -e "..." > <artifact>`, `jq '...' <artifact> > <artifact>`, `python -c "...open(...,'w')..."`, `sed -i`, `awk -i inplace`, or any shell redirection (`>`, `>>`, `| tee`) onto a skill artifact regardless of interpreter. **Writing a helper script under `/tmp` or anywhere else to assemble a skill artifact is also forbidden** — the build-assembler pattern (`/tmp/build-caseplan.js`, `/tmp/gen-tasks.py`, etc.) is the same Rule 13 violation as inline `node -e`, regardless of "mechanical copy" or "avoid Read+Write churn" framing. If `caseplan.json` exceeds ~30KB and a single Write feels too large, split into the Phase-2-skeleton-then-Phase-3-fill cadence (per [case-editing-operations.md § Per-section batch write contract](references/case-editing-operations.md#per-section-batch-write-contract--canonical)) — never via helper script. Bash subprocesses OK ONLY for UUID v4 generation (`node -e "console.log(crypto.randomUUID())"` for `operate.json.projectId` and `entry-points.json` `uniqueId` — subprocess MUST NOT `require('fs')` or use redirection), CLI metadata fetches, validate, debug, and solution scaffold/upload. **Prefixed IDs (`Stage_`, `t`, `Rule_`, etc.) are picked inline by the agent — no subprocess.** See [references/case-editing-operations.md § Tool usage](references/case-editing-operations.md#tool-usage--mandatory).
14. **Always run `uip solution resources refresh` before `uip solution upload` or `uip maestro case debug`** — syncs resources from `bindings_v2.json` so Studio Web can resolve connector dependencies.
15. **Never auto-invoke `uipath-design`.** On Phase 0 threshold breach or stuck-round detection, print plain-text suggestion of the skill name. User re-invokes manually. No tool-call cross-skill handoff.
16. **Caseplan task `type` enum is closed — 9 values, schema-kebab.** Any task node written into `caseplan.json` MUST have `type` exactly one of: `process` | `agent` | `rpa` | `action` | `api-workflow` | `case-management` | `execute-connector-activity` | `wait-for-connector` | `wait-for-timer`. **Never** write the plugin folder name (`connector-activity`, `connector-trigger`) or the CLI `--type` flag value into the JSON node — those name the planning artifacts, not the schema. Never write `external-agent`, `external-workflow`, `document-extraction`, `flow-process`, `wait-for-event`, or any hallucinated value — there is no plugin to back them. `external-agent`, `external-workflow`, `document-extraction`, and `flow-process` are **not supported yet**. See [references/case-schema.md § Task type](references/case-schema.md) and the Plugin Index naming-asymmetry table below.
17. **Empty registry lookup → AskUserQuestion for force pull BEFORE any placeholder fallback.** When a planning-phase lookup returns 0 matches across all relevant cache files, present AskUserQuestion `Force pull and re-resolve` / `Skip and use placeholders` BEFORE writing any placeholder T-entries or invoking per-plugin Unresolved Fallback paths. Apply per lookup-batch (one prompt covers all empties in the batch — do not prompt per-task). Do NOT pre-judge based on resource-name heuristics ("looks vendor-specific, won't match anyway") — that is the user's call. Placeholder fallback is only valid AFTER the user explicitly picks `Skip`. See [references/registry-discovery.md § MUST: Confirm Before Placeholder Fallback](references/registry-discovery.md#must-confirm-before-placeholder-fallback).
18. **Layout state lives in top-level `layout`, not on the node/edge.** Do NOT emit node-level `position`, `style`, `measured`, `width`, `height`, `zIndex`. Do NOT compute stage `position.x = 100 + count * 500`. Do NOT emit edge `data.waypoints`. Emit top-level `layout: {}` (empty object) — FE auto-layouts on canvas load. The frontend's `transformCaseInMemoryJsonToDiskJson` strips these fields anyway when round-tripping through canvas; emitting them is harmless on read but wastes tokens. See [`references/case-editing-operations.md`](references/case-editing-operations.md).

## Workflow

Up to seven hard stops (Phase 0 + Phase 2 second prompt + Phase 4 conditional): **Phase 0** (interview → sdd.md, only when sdd.md absent) → approve → **Phase 1 Planning** (sdd.md → tasks.md) → approve → **Phase 2 Prototyping** (placeholder) → publish-for-review stop → continue-after-publish stop (publish branch only) → **Phase 3 Implementation** (detail) → **Phase 4 Validate** (retry-cap stop on 3rd failure) → **Phase 5 Debug** (Run vs Skip-to-Publish stop) → **Phase 6 Publish** (Publish vs Done stop).

### Phase 0 — Interview (conditional)

Triggered when `sdd.md` absent at resolved path. Read [references/phase-0-interview.md](references/phase-0-interview.md) for the interview modes (listen → sketch → progressive ask-walk → resolve → approve), thresholds, soft-redirect contract, resumption, and HTML preview offer. Produces:

> **Read budget for Phase 0.** Read `phase-0-interview.md`, `references/sdd-generation-rules.md` (the mental model + task-type reasoning the progressive walk relies on), and `assets/templates/sdd-template.md` to begin the interview. Do NOT preload plugin `impl-json.md` files — those are needed only in Phase 2/3 and pulled in just-in-time per T-entry.

- `sdd.md` — generated against `assets/templates/sdd-template.md`
- `tasks/registry-resolved.json` — per-task registry resolutions
- `sdd.draft.md` — intermediate, deleted at approval
- `sdd-viewer.html` — optional, rendered from `assets/templates/sdd-viewer.html` when user accepts the preview offer; Phase 1 ignores it

If `sdd.md` already exists: skip Phase 0, hand to Phase 1 unchanged.

### Phase 1 — Planning

Read [references/planning.md](references/planning.md). Produces:

- `tasks/tasks.md` — T-numbered entries (stages → tasks → conditions → SLA)
- `tasks/registry-resolved.json` — audit trail

HARD STOP: AskUserQuestion approval. Loop on `Request changes`.

### Phase 2 — Prototyping

Read [references/implementation.md](references/implementation.md) + [references/phased-execution.md](references/phased-execution.md). Builds structural shape only:

1. Solution + project + root case (Step 6)
2. Triggers — manual / timer / event, including placeholder event triggers per Rule 8 (Step 6.1)
3. Global variables + arguments (Step 6.2) — including In arguments whose `elementId` references a `TriggerId` captured in Step 6.1
4. Stages (Step 7)
5. Tasks — shape only (Step 9): non-connector with full `data.inputs[]` schema + empty values; connector with `typeId` + `connectionId` only (no `case spec`); unresolved as placeholders per Rule 8
6. Informational validate (Step 9.5.1) — do NOT halt on errors/warnings
7. **HARD STOP** (Step 9.5.2–9.5.5): `Publish for review` / `Skip publish and continue` / `Abort`. On `Publish`: `uip solution resources refresh --solution-folder <SolutionDir> --output json` then `uip solution upload`, print DesignerUrl, AskUserQuestion: `Continue to phase 3` / `Abort`. On `Abort`: dump `build-issues.md`, exit (no cleanup).

### Phase 3 — Implementation

Re-read `tasks.md` AND `caseplan.json` (Step 9.6). Then:

1. Connector schema + defaults (Step 9.7) — `is resources/triggers describe`
2. I/O binding all task classes (Step 9.8) — per [`plugins/variables/io-binding/impl-json.md`](references/plugins/variables/io-binding/impl-json.md)
3. Conditions all 4 scopes (Step 10)
4. SLA + escalation (Step 11)

No hard stop on Phase 3 exit — proceed directly to Phase 4.

### Phase 4 — Validate

1. Full validate (Step 12). Retry up to 3×; on 3rd failure **HARD STOP** AskUserQuestion: `Retry with fix` / `Pause for manual edit` / `Abort`
2. Dump `build-issues.md` (Step 12.1)

### Phase 5 — Debug

Completion report + **HARD STOP** AskUserQuestion (Step 13): `Run debug session` / `Skip to Publish`. On `Run`: `uip solution resources refresh` then `uip maestro case debug` (never auto-run — Rule 12). Loop on completion until `Skip to Publish`.

### Phase 6 — Publish

**HARD STOP** AskUserQuestion (Step 14): `Publish to Studio Web` / `Done`. On `Publish`: `uip solution resources refresh` then `uip solution upload`, print DesignerUrl (Step 15). Exit on either choice.

> **Naming asymmetry — read carefully.** Three names exist for connector + timer tasks. Pick the right one by column. Schema-kebab is the only value that goes into `caseplan.json` `type` (Rule 16).

| sdd.md `Type:` value / caseplan.json `type` (schema-kebab) | Plugin folder | CLI `--type` flag (`tasks describe`) |

| [timer](references/plugins/triggers/timer/planning.md) | Scheduled start |
| [event](references/plugins/triggers/event/planning.md) | External connector event |

**Conditions** (`references/plugins/conditions/`):

| Plugin | Scope |
|--------|-------|
| [stage-entry-conditions](references/plugins/conditions/stage-entry-conditions/planning.md) | Stage entered |
| [stage-exit-conditions](references/plugins/conditions/stage-exit-conditions/planning.md) | Stage exits |
| [task-entry-conditions](references/plugins/conditions/task-entry-conditions/planning.md) | Task starts |
| [case-exit-conditions](references/plugins/conditions/case-exit-conditions/planning.md) | Case completes/exits |

> **Connector-bound rules:** a `wait-for-connector` rule in any condition scope must carry the connector configuration under `rule.uipath` (built from `case spec --type trigger`, like the connector-trigger task) — bare connector rules are invalid in Studio Web and are NOT caught by CLI `validate`. See [connector-trigger-common.md § Target: connector-bound condition rule](references/connector-trigger-common.md#target-connector-bound-condition-rule).

## Anti-patterns

- **Do NOT leave a regular stage without an entry condition.** With edges retired, stage entry conditions are the sole reachability contract. Every regular stage needs ≥1 `stage-entry-conditions` rule naming a reachable predecessor; the first stage carries `case-entered`. A stage with no entry condition is orphaned and unreachable.
- **Do NOT validate after each T-entry.** Intermediate states expected invalid. Run `validate` once at end of Phase 2 (informational) and once in Phase 4 (authoritative).
- **`tasks.md` (Phase 1) uses per-section batched Edit-append — NOT per-T-entry, NOT one mega-Write.** One Read + N Edit-appends per section (§4.2.1 vars, §4.3 triggers, §4.4 stages, §4.6 tasks, §4.7 conditions, §4.8 SLA). No re-Read between sibling Edits. **HARD CAP:** after §4.0a Step 1 Seed Write (<1KB header), single Write of whole `tasks.md` is FORBIDDEN regardless of size. Single Edit-append payload >30KB also FORBIDDEN — split per section even if cumulative payload exceeds 30KB. A 96KB tasks.md Write costs ~360s in one turn (20% of session); section-batched Edit-appends spread across ~7 turns of ~50s. TaskUpdate per T-entry preserves audit trail. Recovery on interruption: re-Read `tasks.md`, resume from next un-applied T-entry. See [planning.md § 4.0a](references/planning.md).
- **`caseplan.json` (Phase 2 + 3) uses per-section batched writes — NOT per-T-entry.** One Read at section entry + one validate at section end. Tool primitive scales with section size: **<10 T-entries** → N Edits (one per T-entry, no re-Read between siblings); **≥10 T-entries** → may use single whole-section Write covering the section's nodes array at once, AFTER composing complete section state in reasoning. Untouched siblings (other sections, root fields) MUST be preserved verbatim from the Read — drop nothing. TaskUpdate per T-entry preserves audit trail regardless of write granularity. CLI-gated sections (Phase 2 §4.6 non-connector `tasks describe`, Phase 3 §9.7 connector `case spec`) use gather-then-write. Recovery on interruption: re-Read both files, resume from next un-applied T-entry. Full contract in [case-editing-operations.md § Per-section batch write contract](references/case-editing-operations.md#per-section-batch-write-contract--canonical) and [implementation.md § Per-plugin execution](references/implementation.md).
- **Do NOT emit standalone text-only assistant turns between tool calls.** Status/progress text MUST share its turn with the next `tool_use` (text block + tool_use block in the same assistant content array). Standalone narration turns each pay full inference latency + prompt cache replay (~5s + ~250K cache-read tokens per turn) for no incremental progress. Cap inline status to ≤1 sentence / ~20 tokens. Per-T-entry audit lives in TaskUpdate, NOT in narration.
  - **HARD TOKEN CAP on any single text block: 200 tokens, no exceptions outside the allow-list below.** Allow-listed text blocks (hard-stop AskUserQuestion preambles, Phase 5/6 completion reports, `Publish for review` DesignerUrl print, post-validate result summaries) get a higher ceiling of **500 tokens** — never higher. A text block >200 tokens outside the allow-list, or >500 tokens inside it, is a planning monologue, regardless of content or framing.
  - **Forbidden announcement verbs.** Text blocks (bundled or standalone) starting with `Building`, `Composing`, `Writing`, `Drafting`, `Generating`, `Now I'll`, `Next:`, `Next step:`, `Approach:`, `Strategy:`, `Plan:`, `Caveman push:`, `Big single Write:`, `Let me`, or any other narration of the imminent tool call are FORBIDDEN regardless of length. The tool_use input shows what is being built — restating it in prose is pure cost. If the agent feels the urge to write `Composing Phase 2 caseplan.json — trigger + 64 variables + 10 stages`, it must instead invoke the Write directly with that content as the file body.
  - **Allow-listed exceptions** (may stand alone, capped at 500 tokens): hard-stop AskUserQuestion preambles, final completion reports (Phase 5/6 exit), Phase 2 `Publish for review` DesignerUrl print (Rule 11), and post-validate result summaries (`N errors, M warnings — fixing X` is fine; `Composing fix for ...` is not). Everything else bundles or omits.
- **One task per lane — except parallel members of a `runs-sequentially` group.** Default: each task own `lane` index in `stageNode.data.tasks[laneIndex][]`, lane is FE layout only. Exception: tasks sharing a `runs-sequentially` task-entry condition that are meant to run in parallel share the same lane (shared lane = parallel siblings inside the sequential group, carries execution semantics). Solo runs-sequentially tasks still get their own lane.
- **Do NOT edit `content/*.bpmn`.** Auto-generated, will be overwritten. Edit `content/*.json` only.
- **Do NOT fabricate expression syntax for conditional SLA rules.** Describe condition in natural language; execution phase determines exact form.
- **Do NOT invoke other skills automatically.** If case needs process/agent/action that doesn't exist, emit placeholder task (Rule 8) and list missing resources in completion report. On-demand resource creation is future milestone.
