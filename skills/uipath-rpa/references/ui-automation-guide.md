# UI Automation Guide

Quick reference for UI automation in UiPath workflows — covers both coded workflows (C#) and XAML/RPA workflows.

## Prerequisites

See [uia-prerequisites.md](uia-prerequisites.md).

**Required package:** `UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities`

> **For full activity details:** check `{PROJECT_DIR}/.local/docs/packages/UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities/`.

## Mandatory: Generate Targets Before Writing Any UI Code

Before writing ANY target — whether C# (`uiAutomation.Open(...)`, `Descriptors.App.Screen.Element`) or XAML (`<uix:TargetApp>`, `<uix:TargetAnchorable>`):

1. **NEVER hand-write selectors.** Hand-written selectors will have invalid syntax, wrong attribute names, missing required attributes (`SearchSteps`, `ContentHash`, `Reference`), or target the wrong element. They fail validation or break at runtime.
2. **NEVER guess selector attributes** from HTML/DOM structure, element tag names, or CSS classes. Selectors are generated from the live application tree by probing elements — not from source code inspection.
3. **ALWAYS follow the target configuration steps** from [uia-configure-target-workflows.md](uia-configure-target-workflows.md). Use the returned XAML/references exactly as provided. Do not modify selectors, content hashes, or reference IDs.

> This gate applies regardless of how simple the target seems. Even a `<webctrl tag='BODY' />` selector will fail validation without proper attributes. The cost of running target configuration is always lower than debugging hand-written selectors.

## Common UIA Pitfalls

- **SelectItem on web dropdowns** — `SelectItem` may fail on custom `<select>` elements. Workaround: use `TypeInto` instead.
- **ScreenPlay overuse** — UITask/ScreenPlay is non-deterministic and slow. Always try proper selectors first.
- **Wrong Object Repository references** — never copy references from examples or other projects. Always use `uia-configure-target` to generate them for the current application state.
- **Launching the app before configuring targets** — do NOT launch the target application before running `uia-configure-target`. The skill captures the window tree first and only launches if the app isn't found. Launching preemptively risks targeting the wrong window.
- **Using `InjectJsScript` instead of standard activities** — do NOT use `InjectJsScript` when standard UI activities (GetText, Click, TypeInto, ExtractTableData, etc.) with configured targets would work. `InjectJsScript` is a last resort — it's hard to debug, fragile to page changes, and bypasses the Object Repository.

## Configuring Targets (Object Repository)

See [uia-configure-target-workflows.md](uia-configure-target-workflows.md) for the full configure-target workflow, rules, indication fallback, and multi-step UI flows.

### Multi-Page Application State Management

When automating multi-page web applications (e.g., a site with different pages at different URLs), configure separate Object Repository screens for each page. **Use Servo to navigate the browser to the correct page before configuring targets.**

The workflow is: **Servo → bring app to target page → configure targets → Servo → next page → configure targets → ...**

URL wildcards in window selectors (e.g., `url='https://example.com/*'`) match ALL tabs from that domain. Close unwanted tabs before capture to avoid targeting the wrong page. See [uia-configure-target-workflows.md](uia-configure-target-workflows.md) and [uia-multi-step-flows.md](uia-multi-step-flows.md) for full details.

### Multi-Step UI Flows (Advancing Application State)

## UIA Activity-Docs Discovery

The UIA activity-docs version folder may contain additional guides (selector creation, target configuration, CV targeting, selector improvement). Discover them by globbing: `Glob: pattern="**/*.md" path="../../references/activity-docs/UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities/{closest}/"`. These are **reference docs to read and follow** — they are NOT invocable as slash commands. Read the relevant `.md` file and follow its steps using the `uip rpa` CLI commands directly.

---

## For Coded Workflows

**Service accessor:** `uiAutomation` (type `IUiAutomationAppService`)

For coded-specific API: `.local/docs/packages/UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities/`.

### Workflow Pattern

1. **Open** or **Attach** to an application screen — returns a `UiTargetApp` handle.
2. Use the `UiTargetApp` handle to perform element interactions (Click, TypeInto, GetText, etc.).
3. The `UiTargetApp` is `IDisposable` — use `using` blocks or dispose manually.

### Screen Handle Affinity (Critical)

**Each `UiTargetApp` handle is bound to a specific screen.** Element descriptors can ONLY be used with the handle for the screen they belong to. Using a descriptor from Screen A on a handle attached to Screen B will fail with `"Target name 'X' is not part of the current screen."`.

```csharp
// CORRECT — use Home elements on the homeScreen handle
var homeScreen = uiAutomation.Open(Descriptors.MyApp.Home);
homeScreen.Click(Descriptors.MyApp.Home.Products);   // OK

// Then attach to the next screen for its elements
var formScreen = uiAutomation.Attach(Descriptors.MyApp.Form);
formScreen.TypeInto(Descriptors.MyApp.Form.Email, "test@example.com");  // OK

// WRONG — using a Home element on the Form screen handle
formScreen.Click(Descriptors.MyApp.Home.Loans);  // FAILS
```

**When navigating multi-screen flows:** perform all interactions for one screen before attaching to the next.

### Target Resolution

Each method on `UiTargetApp` accepts targets in multiple forms:
- **`string target`** — a target name defined in the Object Repository screen.
- **`IElementDescriptor elementDescriptor`** — a strongly-typed Object Repository descriptor (e.g., `Descriptors.MyApp.LoginScreen.Username`).
- **`TargetAnchorableModel target`** — accessed via the `UiTargetApp` indexer: `app["targetName"]` or `app[Descriptors.MyApp.Screen.Element]`.
- **`RuntimeTarget target`** — a runtime target returned by `GetChildren` or `GetRuntimeTarget`.

### Finding Descriptors (Mandatory)

**MANDATORY for any workflow that uses `uiAutomation.*` calls.** Follow this decision tree in **strict order** — stop at the first step that yields the descriptor you need.

> **CRITICAL:** Steps 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 MUST be followed sequentially. NEVER skip to Step 4 (UITask).

#### Step 1 — Check the project's Object Repository

Read `<PROJECT_DIR>/.local/.codedworkflows/ObjectRepository.cs`. This file is auto-generated by Studio and contains a `Descriptors` class with the hierarchy `Descriptors.<App>.<Screen>.<Element>`.

**Important:** Add the ObjectRepository using statement:
```csharp
using <ProjectNamespace>.ObjectRepository;
```

#### Step 2 — Check UILibrary NuGet packages

Look in `project.json` → `dependencies` for packages matching `*.UILibrary`, `*.ObjectRepository`, `*.Descriptors`, or `*.UIAutomation`. Inspect with `uip rpa inspect-package --use-studio`.

For UILibrary packages, use the **package** namespace, not the project namespace:
```csharp
using <PackageNamespace>.ObjectRepository;
```

#### Step 3 — Configure the target

See [uia-configure-target-workflows.md](uia-configure-target-workflows.md) for the full configure-target workflow.

After the skill completes, re-read `ObjectRepository.cs` and search for the returned reference IDs to find the exact `Descriptors.<App>.<Screen>.<Element>` paths.

#### Step 4 — UITask / ScreenPlay (last resort only)

ScreenPlay (`UITask`) is an AI-powered agent that performs UI interactions without precise selectors. Use it **only** when Step 3 selectors are genuinely unreliable.

### Coded-Specific Pitfalls

- **Missing ObjectRepository using** — without `using <ProjectNamespace>.ObjectRepository;`, you get `CS0103: The name 'Descriptors' does not exist in the current context`
- **Screen handle mismatch** — using an element descriptor on the wrong screen handle causes `"Target name 'X' is not part of the current screen."` Always use the correct handle for each screen's elements.

## For XAML Workflows

For XAML-specific activity details: `.local/docs/packages/UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities/`.

### Key Concepts

#### Application Card (Use Application/Browser)

Every UI automation workflow starts with an **Application Card** (`uix:NApplicationCard`) that opens or attaches to a desktop application or web browser. All UI activities (Click, TypeInto, GetText, etc.) must be placed inside an Application Card scope.

#### Target Configuration

Follow [uia-configure-target-workflows.md](uia-configure-target-workflows.md) to generate the Application Card's `TargetApp` and each activity's `TargetAnchorable`. The skill returns ready-to-use XAML attributes — copy them exactly into your workflow:

- **Screen XAML** → goes into `<uix:NApplicationCard.TargetApp>` as a `<uix:TargetApp ... />` element
- **Element XAML** → goes into `<uix:NGetText.Target>` (or Click, TypeInto, etc.) as a `<uix:TargetAnchorable ... />` element

When an element is reused across multiple activities, use the same returned XAML snippet for each one.

### Common Activities

| Activity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Use Application/Browser** | Opens/attaches to a desktop app or browser — required scope for all UI actions |
| **Click** | Clicks a specified UI element |
| **Type Into** | Enters text in a text box or input field |
| **Get Text** | Extracts text from a UI element |
| **Select Item** | Selects an item from a dropdown |
| **Check/Uncheck** | Toggles a checkbox |
| **Keyboard Shortcuts** | Sends keyboard shortcuts to a UI element |
| **Check App State** | Verifies if a UI element exists (conditional branching) |
| **Take Screenshot** | Captures a screenshot of an app or element |
| **Extract Table Data** | Extracts tabular data from a web page or application |
| **ScreenPlay** | AI-powered UI task execution (last resort — non-deterministic and slow) |

### XAML-Specific Pitfalls

- **Missing `xmlns:uix`** — every UIA workflow needs `xmlns:uix="http://schemas.uipath.com/workflow/activities/uix"` on the root `<Activity>` element
