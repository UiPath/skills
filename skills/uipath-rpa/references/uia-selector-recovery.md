# Runtime Selector Failure Recovery

"UI element not found", "UI element is invalid", element not on screen -- these surface at runtime, not during static validation. They occur when a selector was captured against one app state but the DOM changed by the time the activity executes.

When a workflow fails at runtime with a selector error:

1. **The app is already in the right state.** The debug session paused at the failing activity, so the app's current DOM reflects the state that activity needs to target.
2. **Identify the failing element** -- read the error to find which descriptor/element failed.
3. **Read the window selector** -- from the Object Repository files, find the screen's selector that scopes the failing element.
4. **Run the `uia-improve-selector` skill in recover mode.** Read `<PROJECT_DIR>/.local/docs/packages/UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities/skills/uia-improve-selector/USAGE.md`, pick the appropriate invocation form for this context, run the staging CLI command from that form, spawn a subagent with the Agent tool to run the skill in recover mode against the staged folder, then run the write-back CLI command from the same form to persist the recovered selector.
5. **Clean up and re-run** -- follow the [Running UI Automation Workflows](uia-debug-workflow.md) procedure (stop, diff, close leaked windows, re-run).

Repeat until the workflow completes successfully. Each failure advances the app to the next problematic state, making recovery self-correcting.
