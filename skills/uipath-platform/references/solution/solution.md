# Solutions (`uip solution`)

Create, pack, publish, deploy, and manage UiPath solution packages.

> For full option details on any command, use `--help` (e.g., `uip solution deploy run --help`).

## What is a Solution?

A UiPath Solution is a container that groups multiple automation projects (processes, libraries, tests) into a single deployable unit. Solutions enable:

- **Bundled deployment** -- Deploy multiple projects together as one package
- **Version management** -- Track and version the entire solution as a single entity
- **Configuration management** -- Apply environment-specific configuration at deploy time
- **Multi-environment promotion** -- Move solutions through dev, staging, and production

### Solution File Structure

```
MySolution/
├── MySolution.uipx          <- Solution manifest
├── ProjectA/                <- Automation project
│   ├── project.json / project.uiproj
│   └── *.cs / *.xaml
├── ProjectB/
└── config.json              <- Optional environment config
```

## Solution Lifecycle

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[new] --> B[project add]
    B --> C[resource refresh]
    C --> D[pack]
    D --> E[publish]
    E --> F[deploy run]
    F --> G[activate]
    C --> H[upload]
```

Two distinct distribution paths from the same solution source:
- **`pack` → `publish` → `deploy run`** — promotes a versioned package to Orchestrator.
- **`upload`** — pushes the solution to Studio Web for browser-based debugging only. Does not produce a published package and cannot be deployed via `deploy run`.

Always run `resource refresh` before either path so the bundled artefact files and `userProfile/<userId>/debug_overwrites.json` reflect the current cloud state.
