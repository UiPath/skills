# Author — Create and edit `.flow` files

Capability index for building new flows (greenfield) and editing existing flows (brownfield). Author owns everything that happens on disk, locally, without `uip login`. Authoring journeys terminate at `validate` + `format`; from there, hand off to [operate/CAPABILITY.md](../operate/CAPABILITY.md) to publish, run, or debug.

> **Where you came from / where to go next.** Author is upstream of Operate (build the flow → ship it) and upstream of Diagnose only via Operate (build → run → diagnose). Publish/run/lifecycle lives in [operate/CAPABILITY.md](../operate/CAPABILITY.md); fault triage lives in [diagnose/CAPABILITY.md](../diagnose/CAPABILITY.md).

> **Inherits universal rules from [SKILL.md](../../SKILL.md)** — `--output json`, no `flow debug` without consent, resource discovery order, never invoke other skills automatically, AskUserQuestion dropdown pattern, solution layout, **plain-English narration per logical step**, **granular `TodoWrite` list above the trivial threshold**. The rules below are author-scoped and apply on top.

## When to use this capability

- Create a new Flow project with `uip maestro flow init`
- Edit a `.flow` file — adding nodes, edges, or logic
- Explore available node types via the registry
- Validate a Flow file locally
- Manage variables, subflows, expressions, and output wiring
- Apply required Edit / Write authoring and recognize the narrow CLI carve-outs
- Configure connector, connector-trigger, or managed HTTP nodes; scaffold inline-agent projects
- Plan a complex flow before building

## Critical rules

1. **Always validate node types against the registry before building.** Use `registry search`/`list` for discovery and `registry get` for detailed metadata and definitions.
2. **Use `Edit` / `Write` for every non-carve-out `.flow` mutation.** Use the `uip maestro flow node` / `edge` / `variable` CLI **only** for the carve-outs called out in [editing-operations.md](references/editing-operations.md): connector activity, connector-trigger, and managed HTTP workflows where CLI commands populate product-managed state. For OOTB structural edits — node add/remove, edge add/remove, variables, subflows, trigger swaps, in-place input updates, and inline-agent node/wiring — author the `.flow` JSON directly. Edit/Write produces a reviewable line-by-line diff; the CLI returns an opaque "node added" response.
3. **ALWAYS follow the relevant plugin in [plugins/](references/plugins/) for every node type.** Each plugin has a `planning.md` (when to use, selection heuristics, ports) and `impl.md` (registry validation, JSON structure, CLI commands, configuration, debug). For connector nodes, the [connector](references/plugins/connector/impl.md) plugin covers connection binding, enriched metadata, and field resolution — required before building. Without this, node configuration will be wrong — errors that `flow validate` does not catch.
4. **ALWAYS check for existing connections** before using any node that requires one — connector activities, connector triggers, and managed HTTP nodes in connector mode. **If no healthy connection exists for the target connector, STOP.** Surface it in **Open Questions** during planning. See the relevant plugin for recovery steps: [connector/impl.md](references/plugins/connector/impl.md), [connector-trigger/impl.md](references/plugins/connector-trigger/impl.md), [http/impl.md](references/plugins/http/impl.md).
5. **Edit `<ProjectName>.flow` only** — other generated files (`bindings_v2.json`, `entry-points.json`, `operate.json`, `package-descriptor.json`) are managed by the CLI and may be overwritten. To declare flow inputs/outputs, add variables in the `.flow` file (see [shared/file-format.md](../shared/file-format.md)).
6. **`targetPort` is required on every edge** — `validate` rejects edges without it.
7. **Every node type needs a `definitions` entry** — copy from `uip maestro flow registry get <nodeType>` output. Never hand-write definitions. The definition is the sole source for BPMN type (`model.type`), serviceType, event definitions, and binding/context templates — none of that belongs on the instance.
8. **Script nodes must `return` an object** — `return { key: value }`, not a bare scalar.
9. **Validate once at the end** — run `uip maestro flow validate` only after all nodes, edges, and configuration are complete. Do not validate after each individual node add or edit — intermediate states are expected to be invalid.
10. **Manage variables with `Edit` against the `.flow` file** — there are no CLI commands for variable management. Use `Edit` to add/remove/update entries in the `variables` section of the `.flow` file. See [shared/variables-and-expressions.md](../shared/variables-and-expressions.md).
11. **Every `out` variable must be mapped on every reachable End node** — missing output mappings cause runtime errors. See [shared/variables-and-expressions.md](../shared/variables-and-expressions.md).
12. **`=js:` prefix is REQUIRED on every `$vars`/`$metadata`/`$self` reference in a value field** — not on condition expressions (decision, switch, HTTP branch), which are auto-evaluated as JS. Without it, the BPMN runtime sees a literal string and `flow validate` fails with MST-9107. See [shared/node-output-wiring.md](../shared/node-output-wiring.md) for the canonical rule and per-node-type field reference, and [shared/variables-and-expressions.md](../shared/variables-and-expressions.md) for the expression system.
13. **Always run `flow format` after edits** — `uip maestro flow format <ProjectName>.flow` is the canonical layout step. Format arranges nodes horizontally, sets every node's `size` to `{ "width": 96, "height": 96 }`, and recurses into subflows (`subflows[<id>].layout`). Skipping format is the most common cause of misshapen rectangles in Studio Web.
14. **Don't hand-write `layout.nodes` or `subflows[<id>].layout`** — these are owned by `flow format`. When authoring nodes, any placeholder `position` is fine (e.g. `{ x: 0, y: 0 }`); format rewrites it on save. Sticky notes (`type: "stickyNote"`) are the one exception — format preserves their custom size and position. See [shared/file-format.md — Layout](../shared/file-format.md#layout).
15. **Every data-producing node MUST have a matching `variables.nodes[]` entry — this is what makes `$vars.<sourceNodeId>.output` resolve.** The BPMN emitter walks `variables.nodes[]` to write the process-level `<uipath:inputOutput>` declarations the runtime needs. The instance `outputs` block is **only** consumed by BPMN serialization on end-style nodes (to map workflow-level `out` variables); for action / trigger nodes it is documentation, not behavior. Skipping `variables.nodes[]` produces a flow that passes `flow validate` but resolves `$vars.<sourceNodeId>.output` to `undefined` at runtime (MST-9972). **Always run `uip maestro flow format` after structural edits — it regenerates `variables.nodes[]` from `nodes[]` + `definitions[]`** (matching what `uip maestro flow node add` and the canvas save path do), so this becomes self-healing as long as you `format`. See [shared/file-format.md — Node outputs](../shared/file-format.md#node-outputs).
16. **Node instances normally have no `model` block** — BPMN type, serviceType, version, event definitions, and binding/context templates live in the node's **definition** (in the top-level `definitions[]` array, copied verbatim from `registry get`). The runtime hydrates these from the definition at serialization time. Instance-specific identity fields usually live under `inputs`: `entryPointId`, `isDefaultEntryPoint` (triggers), `color`/`content` (sticky notes). **Exception:** attached inline-agent resource nodes whose definition declares `model.source: true` require only `model.source = <resourceId>` on the instance; do not copy `serviceType`, `version`, or `context` into the instance model. `uipath.agent.autonomous` itself uses `inputs.source = <ProjectId>` and no node instance `model` block.

## Anti-patterns

- **Never run `uip maestro flow init` outside a solution directory** — see [SKILL.md rule #6](../../SKILL.md#critical-rules-universal) for the required double-nested `<Solution>/<Project>/<Project>.flow` layout and the self-check.
- **Never guess node schemas** — use `registry get` for all node types. Guessed port names or input fields cause silent wiring failures.
- **Never skip capability discovery for connector nodes** — run `registry search` to confirm the connector exists and what operations it supports before building. See [connector/planning.md](references/plugins/connector/planning.md). Skipping this is the #1 cause of designing around a connector that doesn't exist or an operation it doesn't support.
- **Never replace a registered connector operation with `core.logic.mock` because configuration cannot run** — if `registry search` / `registry get` finds `uipath.connector.<connector-key>.<operation>`, add that real connector node. Missing live connections, missing tenant access, or prompts that ask you to only plan `--detail` mean "leave connector `inputs` empty and record the planned detail/open question", not "downgrade to a mock". `flow validate` accepts an unconfigured connector node; Studio Web and reviewers need the real connector key in the `.flow`.
- **Never edit `content/*.bpmn`** — it is auto-generated from the `.flow` file and will be overwritten.
- **Never use `core.logic.mock` when the resource is in the same solution** — use `--local` discovery instead. Mock placeholders are only for resources that are not in the current solution and not yet published.
- **Never hand-write `definitions` entries** — always copy from registry output. Hand-written definitions have wrong port schemas and cause validation failures.
- **Never put a full `model` block on node instances** — BPMN type, serviceType, event definition, binding templates, and context templates all live in the node's **definition** (copied verbatim from `registry get` into `definitions[]`). Instances carry only per-instance data: `inputs`, `outputs`, `display`. Identity fields like `entryPointId` / `isDefaultEntryPoint` (triggers) and `color` / `content` (sticky notes) live under `inputs`. **Exception:** attached inline-agent resource nodes whose definition declares `model.source: true` require the minimal instance block `"model": { "source": "<resourceId>" }`; never add `serviceType`, `version`, or `context` to that instance model. `uipath.agent.autonomous` itself uses `inputs.source = <ProjectId>` and no node instance `model` block.
- **Never author `model.context[]` on resource-node instances** — resource-node instances have no `model` block. For `uipath.core.*` resource nodes (rpa, agent, flow, agentic-process, api-workflow, hitl), the definition (from `registry get`) already carries `model.context[]` with `<bindings.{name}>` placeholders. Your job is to add matching entries to the top-level `bindings[]` array — two entries per resource node (`name` + `folderPath`) with `resourceKey` matching the definition's `model.bindings.resourceKey`. At BPMN emit, the runtime rewrites `<bindings.{name}>` → `=bindings.{id}` via `(resourceKey, name)` matching. Without the top-level `bindings[]` entries, `uip maestro flow validate` passes but `uip maestro flow debug` fails with "Folder does not exist or the user does not have access to the folder." See the resource plugin's `impl.md`.
- **Never put a `ui` block on node instances** — position and size belong in the top-level `layout.nodes` object. Nodes with `"ui": { "position": ... }` use the wrong format and may not render correctly in Studio Web.
- **Never skip `flow format` before publish or debug** — without it, hand-written `layout` data renders as misshapen rectangles in Studio Web (the MST-9061 failure mode). See rule #13 above for the format step.
- **Never validate after every individual edit** — intermediate flow states (e.g., node added but not yet wired) are expected to be invalid. Run `uip maestro flow validate` once after the full build is complete.
- **Never use `console.log` in script nodes** — `console` is not available in the Jint runtime. Use `return { debug: value }` to inspect values.
- **Never forget output mapping on End nodes** — every `out` variable in `variables.globals` must have a `source` expression in every reachable End node's `outputs`. Missing mappings cause silent runtime failures.
- **Never update `in` variables** — only `inout` variables can be modified via `variableUpdates`. Input variables are read-only after flow start.
- **Never reference parent-scope `$vars` inside a subflow** — subflows have isolated scope. Pass values explicitly via subflow inputs.
- **Never use `core.action.http` (v1)** — the v1 node is deprecated for all HTTP requests (both connector-authenticated and manual). For connector-auth, v1's `authenticationType: "connection"` input does not pass IS credentials at runtime. Use `core.action.http.v2` (Managed HTTP Request) for every HTTP node. See [http/planning.md](references/plugins/http/planning.md).
- **Never hand-write `inputs.detail` for managed HTTP nodes** — run `uip maestro flow node configure` to populate the `inputs.detail` structure, generate `bindings_v2.json`, and create the connection resource file. Hand-written configurations miss the `essentialConfiguration` block and fail at runtime.
- **Never write `$vars.X` (or `$metadata.X`, `$self.X`) without `=js:` in value fields** — `flow validate` flags this as MST-9107. See rule #12 above and [shared/node-output-wiring.md](../shared/node-output-wiring.md) for the per-node-type field reference.
- **Never reuse a reference ID (mailbox folder, Slack channel, Jira project, Google Sheet, etc.) from a prior flow or session** — reference IDs are scoped to the specific authenticated account behind the connection. A `parentFolderId` from one Outlook mailbox is invalid in another; a Slack channel ID from one workspace is invalid in another. A reused ID passes `flow validate` and `node configure` cleanly, then faults silently at runtime with no resolvable error. Always re-resolve via `uip is resources run list <connector-key> <objectName> --connection-id <CURRENT_CONNECTION_ID> --output json` against the connection bound to this flow — do not paste a value you saw in another flow. See [connector/impl.md — Step 4](references/plugins/connector/impl.md) and [connector-trigger/impl.md — Step 3](references/plugins/connector-trigger/impl.md).
- **Never include `[*]` literally in a connector `bodyParameters` / `queryParameters` / `pathParameters` key** — `[*]` in `requestFields[].name` is an array marker, not part of the wire key. Strip it and pass an array value of the field's `dataType` (e.g. `"fields.labels[*]"` → `"fields.labels": ["a", "b"]`). Supported only when `[*]` is the name suffix; `[*].` (segments after) is not authorable. `flow validate` misses this; runtime rejects the key. See [connector/impl.md — Step 6b](references/plugins/connector/impl.md) for the full table including expression-value handling.
